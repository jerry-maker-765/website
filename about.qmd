About this site
![UofT](image1.jpeg)
Welcome to my personal project website, a space I've built using the programming knowledge and skills I've learned in the classroom. On this platform, I showcase various projects and hands-on experiences from my software development journey, each one an exploration of new technologies and an application of what I've learned.

In addition to this, I also share my views on future technology trends on this site and how I continue to learn and adapt to this rapidly evolving field. Whether you are a friend interested in programming or a potential partner, I welcome you to explore my work in depth and discuss, learn and grow together.

Welcome, let's travel together in the world of code and explore the infinite possibilities.
